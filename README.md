# taxi-dijkstra

This is an application of Dijsktra's algorithm to find the optimal routing of
taxis in a city, where some taxis at initial positions need to be assigned some
customers and then fulfill the requests of these customers in a certain order,
minimizing the overall waiting time of the customers.

This was a project for the 2024 HackaTUM hackathon, as this was the main
challenge proposed by sponsor T-Systems.
